## Course Description

DevOps describes a set of processes that bring development and operations teams together to simplify software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can deliver with traditional software development approaches. In this course, Dipali Kulshrestha—an AWS-certified software programmer and an advocate of DevOps practices—covers the concepts of DevOps with hands-on demos to create and automate CI/CD (continuous implementation and continuous delivery) pipelines. Learn about AWS services, including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodeArtifact, and CodePipeline. Explore configuration techniques and advanced features. Plus, find out how to implement DevOps with AWS offerings to increase security, scalability, reliability, and simplicity of the development processes.
